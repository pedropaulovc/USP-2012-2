Unfortunatly, that&#039;s all there is to the film. The script is almost as big a joke as the charactors, and everything else follows the same path. If you&#039;re looking for a tease then see this flick, otherwise stay as far away as possible.","tomatoUserMeter":"73","tomatoUserRating":"3.2","tomatoUserReviews":"637,140","Response":"True"}
